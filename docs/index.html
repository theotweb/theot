			<p>New Discoveries of the Project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					We have validated the working designations of EthI and EthII and given much greater precision to
					each as
					well as the relationship between the two.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have established a profile of the nature of the Period that has given us the Earliest Attested
					textform(s) (EthI) and the demographics of its manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have established a profile of the nature of the Period that has given us the Standardized
					textform(s)
					(EthIIa) and the demographics of its manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have established a profile of the nature of the Period that has given us the Modern Textus
					Receptus
					textform (EthIIb) and the demographics of its manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a previously unidentified textform of the late 19th century which we call the
					LatV, a
					new
					form of the Ge’ez text modified from the Latin Vulgate. We know of this textform from three
					manuscripts.
					The books contained in these three manuscripts cover the book of the twelve, Jeremiah, Enoch,
					Daniel,
					and a
					few other books. We have investigated deeply only the textforms in the book of the twelve minor
					prophets,
					and in Daniel. The LatV version of Bel and the Dragon is a different recension in the LatV text.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a unique state of affairs with the textual history of Deuteronomy 32. Most of the
					EthI biblical manuscripts contain a version of the chapter that aligns not with the
					textform
					of
					biblical manuscripts, but with the version of chapter 32 known from the fifteen biblical canticles
					in
					the
					Psalter and chanted by the community on a regular basis.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered an old, second recension of the Ethiopic Book of Job, which is more than 70%
					different
					from the textform carried in the rest of the tradition, and preserved in two manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered that the level of difference between EthI and EthII textforms of the book of
					Ethiopic
					Daniel is so great that it rises to the level of a different recension carried by EthII. This is in
					addition
					to the discovery of the LatV alternate recension of the book of Daniel.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered two new recensions of the Ethiopic Book of the Song of Songs, the most copied
					book of
					the
					Ethiopic Old Testament (even more than the Psalms). One of these has been known before and is
					designated
					the
					Hebraist or Scholars edition. It contains some 72 additional strophes beyond the standard version
					and is
					known in dozens (if not hundreds) of manuscripts. But the second has been unknown and is known to us
					in
					fewer than 20 manuscripts. It contains 122 additional strophes beyond the standard version.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a form of the text of the book of Ecclesiastes that is more than 20 percent
					different
					from the rest of the tradition. We know this textform from two manuscripts in our sample, and from a
					third
					that was independently verified.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a second, previously unidentified and historically significant, recension of the
					book
					Ezekiel, translated directly from the Hebrew into Ge’ez in 1923 by noted Ethiopian scholar Kidane
					Wald
					Kifle.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a third previously unidentified recension of the LatV of Ezekiel, known to us in
					two
					manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					We confirmed the existence, first noted by Schafers, of a second recension of the book of Jeremiah.
					We
					know
					this recension, dubbed the “Vulgar” recension, in four manuscripts.
				</li>
				<li>
					For the first time, we have analyzed the nature of the relationship between the text of the fifteen
					biblical
					canticles as transmitted in the Psalter and the form of the text carried in biblical manuscripts. We
					have
					conducted three pilot studies for the songs of Hana, Habakkuk, and Jonah. Full information about
					these
					is
					found on the website.
				</li>
				<li>
					We have discovered a form of the text of the book of Ruth that is more than 20 percent different
					from
					the
					rest of the tradition. We know this textform from two manuscripts in our sample.
				</li>
