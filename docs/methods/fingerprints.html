              <b>Late Copies of EAI Text Form Influenced by the EthII Milieu</b> - From their chronology alone, we can see
              that some manuscripts that carry the EthI text form were not copied in the 14-16th centuries, but rather
              were copied in the 17-20th centuries. This documents the ongoing need and desire for the EthI text form,
              even after the EthII text form had become the dominant one being copied. But, one remarkable fact about
              these copies is that they carry readings that did not come into being until the 17th century. We explain
              this not as evidence that they were copied from old manuscripts that already had these readings. Our
              sample does not bear this out. Instead, it points to the likelihood that those copying the older text form
              in the 17-20th centuries did so under the pressure of the new text form that was dominant in their time
              and made concessions to its new readings. This is known as backward influence.
