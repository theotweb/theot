                This tab contains detailed statistical information related to
                the interventions by secondary hands to change and correct
                perceived errors. The columns provide information on the
                quantity and details of the interventions specific to each
                manuscript in the study. This category of data is exploratory
                and has been carried out on only one book (Judges), but
                provides a proof of concept for the idea of visualizing the
                phenomena of scribal intervention.

                  actual philological data are listed in a final column. This

                This tab, on Minority Variant Data, and the next one, on
                Minority Variants Descriptions, contain detailed statistical
                and philological information about shared minority variants
                among the manuscript copies of a book. This tab is organized
                around book id, manuscript id, and the presence or absence
                (specified by a one or a null) of minority variants in
                specific columns of the dots and bars text matrix.

                This tab, on Minority Variant Descriptions, goes with the
                previous one on Minority Variant Data. Whereas the previous
                tab contained only statistical information about the presence
                or absence of a minority variants, this tab provides only the
                listing and description of the minority variants. This tab is
                organized around book id, and tvu number. But the column
                labeled tvu specifies a locus where multiple manuscfripts
                share a particular minority variant. The most important
                column, then, is the one labeled minority variant description
                (mv_desc) a description of the minority variant itself.

                This tab merely specifies the witness number assigned to each
                manuscript in the study. Since there is no consistencey
                maintained around which manuscripts are assigned which witness
                number, this information has no significance beyond the
                specific book it is in. It is, however, useful to be able to
                correlate manuscript sigla with witness number for each book
                study.
